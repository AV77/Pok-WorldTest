## **🕯 Age 13–16 — _The Bond in the Snow_**

Ram was already gone before his body left. School, dinner, polite smiles — he was showing up like a shadow. Nobody noticed. Or maybe they did and hoped he’d snap out of it.

He didn’t.

The night he left, it wasn’t dramatic. He didn’t pack a bag or write a letter. He just stopped pretending he could do this — this future that had been built like a cage around him, lined with good intentions and suffocating pride. Everyone thought he was lucky. No one thought to ask if he was _free_.

So he walked out. Quiet. Fast. Under the cover of a mountain storm that felt more honest than anything he’d said in months.

No badge. No starter. No plan. Just a ration bar, a threadbare jacket, and a storm in his chest that wouldn’t let him stay still.

He kept walking until the trees stopped looking friendly. Until the snow started muting even his breath. He passed ranger signs and ignored them. Past Lake Acuity. Past where kids are warned not to go. His legs gave out near a shrine — half-eaten by moss and buried in frost. He collapsed there. Not because he chose to stop — but because he didn’t know who he was walking toward anymore.

That’s when Ram saw him.

White fur, flickering like wind-drawn flame. Red eyes watching from the treeline. A Hisuian Zorua. Cautious. Silent. Just like Ram.

Ram didn’t move. Didn’t reach. Just whispered,

“I’m not trying to catch you. I just don’t want to be alone.”

Zorua stepped closer. Sat beside Ram. No fear. No trust. Just... being.

And that was enough.

Ram lived like that for a while. Found an abandoned ranger station with half a roof and a door that creaked like it still missed someone. He patched holes with pine needles and tarp. Zorua curled against his chest at night, fur cold but solid. He didn’t light fires unless he had to. Learned how to melt snow in a tin can. Learned which berries don’t kill him. Learned that silence gets louder if you fight it.

A Noctowl started showing up in the evenings. At first, he thought it was stalking him— but it left things at the door: a cracked Pokédex, an old metal button, a coin from a region Ram had never been to. Ram left food in return. It never stayed. But it came back. That was the rhythm he lived in — things not staying, but not abandoning him either.

The first time Zorua got hurt — a deep gash from a Skarmory’s warning swipe — Ram panicked. Cut hisown palm trying to fight it off. With hishand bleeding and your breath sharp, he broke into a League rest stop. Not to rob — just to survive. A nurse caught him. She looked at the blood, then at his face, and asked,

“Is it your little brother?”\
&#x20;You nodded.\
&#x20;She gave you gauze. Didn’t ask more.

Zorua didn’t even flinch while Ram stitched the wound. Just stared at he, eyes steady. That night, Zorua rested his head on Ram’s wrist like he was holding him in place.

***

He wandered through edge towns. Fixed fences. Quieted wild Pokémon without ever throwing a Poké Ball. People started recognizing his silence before his face.

One time, there was a town scared of a wild Sableye. Said it was cursed. He watched it for three days. It was guarding something — a collapsed well where a child had once fallen. He left an offering. It let him touch it. He didn’t explain to the townsfolk. He just helped them build a shrine over the stones.

He didn’t call himself a trainer. Still doesn’t. But Zorua stayed.

Zorua evolved in the middle of a snowfield when Ram stepped in front of a panicked Ursaring to protect a child. Ram couldn’t fight it — but he whispered to Zorua,

“Make it remember something safe.”\
&#x20;And he did. A flicker of firelight. A cave. The scent of crushed Oran berries. The illusion made the beast hesitate — and that was enough.

When it left, he turned around, and Zorua was gone.

In his place was Zoroark. Taller. Steady. Breathing like he finally knew who he was.

He didn’t look proud. Just ready.

Ram never trained him. Never needed to.

He didn’t get his journey the way others did — no professor, no cheers.\
But this was his journey.\
And he earned it in silence.
