# PokéWorldTest
Welcome to PokéWorldTest, a meticulously crafted Pokémon Chronicle world, meticulously documented. This is just a fun little side project where my friends and I are goofing around, building our very own Pokémon-inspired world. We're doing it all in Markdown to keep things simple and easy for everyone to jump in and add their wild ideas.

Think of it as our personal sandbox for creating our characters, and Pokémon that probably make no sense but are a blast to imagine. There's no grand plan here, just a bunch of friends having fun and making up stories together. Come explore the weird and wonderful stuff we're cooking up!
